        <p>A friend reached out to me looking for another critter to add to her daughter's collection and had found 
          this adorable Mimi the Monkey pattern by Jess Huff.  After selecting the colors, I got to work bringing this 
          piece of her safari collection to life with a few extra accessories!

        <p>Growing up, my mom taught me to crochet and I'd occassionally make a scarf here and there.  In 2018 I had
          to have ankle surgery which gave me a lot of free time.  I decided to pick up crochetting again and was looking 
          for a challenge.  I started small with learning new stitches for dishcloths and towels and made a few blankets
          for Christmas that year.  After I was able to conquer those challenges, I saw the cutest little stuffed bunny
          someone had crafted for Easter.  I decided to try it out and after watching many videos and some helpful hints from 
          friends, I was able to get it completed and kept improving my skills with every critter.  I love making all 
          sorts of crochet creations, especially for family and friends.
