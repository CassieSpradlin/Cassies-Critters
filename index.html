      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Growing up, my mom taught me to crochet and I'd occassionally make a scarf here and there.  In 2018 I had
          to have ankle surgery which gave me a lot of free time.  I decided to pick up crochetting again and was looking 
          for a challenge.  I started small with learning new stitches for dishcloths and towels and made a few blankets
          for Christmas that year.  After I was able to conquer those challenges, I saw the cutest little stuffed bunny
          someone had made for Easter.  I decided to try it out and after watching many videos and some helpful hints from 
          friends, I was able to get it completed and kept improving my skills with every critter.  I love making all 
          sorts of crochet creations, especially for family and friends.
